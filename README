This is a library for reading zipfiles.

It's most notable feature is that it is not based on Info-Zip, but it's also
very easy to use:

    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    #include "zipreader.h"

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
            zipreader *z;
            zipreader_file *f;
            z = zipreader_open(0);
            f = zipreader_seek(z, "./README");
            if (!f || !zipreader_extract(f,1)) {
                    puts("err");
                    exit(1);
            }
            exit(0);
    }
